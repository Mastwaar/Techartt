Gift Mode is a thoughtfully designed gifting experience that enables users to make confident, well-informed purchase decisions for their family and closest connections. It transforms traditional gift shopping into a structured, visual, and highly personalized workflow, reducing uncertainty and decision fatigue.

The system captures family context upfront and uses it as a foundation for all interactions. By organizing people, relationships, and preferences in a clear structure, Gift Mode ensures users always evaluate items with the right recipient in mind.

Core Concept
Gift Mode begins by understanding the user’s personal ecosystem. It collects the number of family members along with their relationships, names, and ages, and automatically generates a clear and organized family tree. This family model becomes a persistent reference for current and future gifting decisions.

Key Capabilities

• Intelligent Family Mapping
Gift Mode captures essential family details and converts them into a structured, hierarchical family tree. This ensures clarity, consistency, and long-term usability across multiple gifting occasions.

• Context-Aware Virtual Try-On
Users can try multiple items across different family members, compare results side by side, and evaluate suitability at a glance. The experience supports prioritizing closest or highest-relevance members to focus decision-making where it matters most.

• Decision-Optimized Gift Selection
The feature is designed to minimize second-guessing and overthinking. By enabling structured comparison and visual evaluation, users can confidently narrow down options before committing to a purchase.

• Shareable Gift Widget
Selected items can be shared through a lightweight, embeddable widget. This allows seamless collaboration with partners, friends, or family members and supports alignment before checkout or group gifting.

Designed for Real Gifting Behavior
Gift Mode reflects how people actually shop for gifts. Users often consider multiple individuals simultaneously, revisit options repeatedly, and seek reassurance before finalizing a decision. Gift Mode systematizes this behavior into a clear, visual, and repeatable process.

Product Philosophy
Gift Mode is not a decorative or novelty feature. It functions as a decision-support system for gifting, intentionally designed to reduce friction, increase clarity, and ensure users feel confident that they have chosen the right gift for the right person.
